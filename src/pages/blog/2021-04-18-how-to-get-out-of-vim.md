Hi All! Welcome to Ako.Dev's first of many blog posts. I am excited to be here writing to you today because this is one of the most obnoxious things to deal with when all you need to do is push your code to either bitbucket or github. It is very simple but it can be tricky if you're new to VIM as well as the command line. The image below shows exactly the issue that many of us run into. 

![Terminal Example](/img/screen-shot-2021-04-18-at-1.11.25-am.png "Terminal Example")

`This is going to be three easy steps. `

`1. Press "esc"`

`2. type ":wq"  `

`3. hit enter to save your choice.`

That's right! It's as easy as 1-2-3! Once you see that screen in the terminal window. You type the above three steps and it will continue on with pushing your code to your repository.
