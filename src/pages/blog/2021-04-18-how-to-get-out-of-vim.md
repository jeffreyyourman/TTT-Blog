Hi All! Welcome to Ako.Dev's first of many blog posts. I am excited to be here writing to you today because this is one of the most obnoxious things to deal with when all you need to do is push your code to either bitbucket or github. It is very simple but it can be tricky if you're new to VIM as well as the command line

![Terminal Example](/img/screen-shot-2021-04-18-at-1.11.25-am.png "Terminal Example")

`Hit "esc" then type ":wq" and hit enter to save your choice.`

That's right! It's as easy as that! Once you see that screen. You type the above message and it will bring you out of that screen to continue on with your git commands. ``
